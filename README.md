# Nodejs Typescript Best Practice Skeleton

I am very fond of javascript, once doing one project, my boss insisted me to use typescript to maintain the standard and I started building the proper architecture for the nodejs with typescript. Typescript is actually a superset of javascript, it complies with all the best practices of javascript and let you code efficiently, without thinking of the ECMAscripts es2015 or es2017. Your code will be compiled to support any version of OS and browser. Interesting right !!! Hence, I was convinced by my boss to use the typescript in the project. Thanks to him.

Too much verbose, let's begin with the structure:

## Framework

A good framework consists of the below features:

1. Coding Standard Strictly - which TS strictly follows
2. Error Handling - Getting the right error to understand
3. Logger - To keep the application logs for debugging
4. Middleware - to save you before the business logic
5. TDD - Testing Platform ready
6. Structured routes
7. Constant config for easy config change
8. In built API documentation - Swagger
9. Clustering of application for full performance gain form CPU

Here in this framework I tried to cater all the requirements to make this as the best possible framework to start with.
